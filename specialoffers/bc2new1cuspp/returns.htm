	<h1>Return Policy</h1>
	<p>Customer satisfaction is our top priority. If you are not happy with your purchase (for any reason whatsoever) you are entitled to a
	refund of the full purchase price less any applicable shipping and handling charges.</p>

	<p>Please be sure to include some form of tracking with your package so that, in the event it gets lost in the mail, we can still issue you a credit.</p>
	<p>Additionally, please be sure that your full name is legibly written in the return address field of the package so that we know who to issue the credit to.</p>
	<p>Once we receive your package, your refund will be issued within 2-3 business days. Please allow an additional 3-5 business days for the credit to post to your account once it has been issued.</p>
